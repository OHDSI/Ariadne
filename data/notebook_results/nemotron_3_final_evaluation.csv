The target concept *Infective arthritis of ankle and/or foot* precisely denotes infection of the ankle or foot joint, preserving the same anatomical scope without expanding to other joints or restricting to a single side. It does not add extra anatomical qualifiers (e.g., “left”, “right”, “bilateral”) that are not present in the source, thus it is not more general or more specific.  - Generality (Rule 2): The target does not introduce details that are absent from the source (such as a specific pathogen, laterality, or additional clinical features not mentioned). It simply restates the bacterial etiology and the joint locations, matching the source’s level of detail.  - Context Validation (Rule 3): The concept is classified within the SNOMED vocabulary, under the Condition domain, with parent hierarchies that include “Lower limb joint arthritis”, “Infective arthritis”, and “Disorder of joint of ankle and/or foot”. These parents confirm that the concept is semantically aligned with bacterial joint infections of the ankle/foot, making it clinically appropriate for the source term.  - Rule 4 Compliance: The concept’s name and definition do not contain non‑essential qualifiers such as “unspecified” or “not otherwise specified”; they are directly relevant to the clinical description.  - Key Clinical Details Preservation:    - Etiology: Both the source and target specify a bacterial infection.   - Location: Both mention ankle and foot involvement.   - Clinical presentation: The source lists acute pain, swelling, erythema, and limited motion; the target describes pain, swelling, synovial inflammation, and potential joint destruction, which encompass the essential inflammatory signs.   - Management: Both require targeted antimicrobial therapy and may involve orthopedic intervention (e.g., joint drainage), satisfying the treatment aspect of the source.  Because the target concept exactly mirrors the source’s clinical description—bacterial etiology, ankle‑foot joint involvement, acute inflammatory signs, and appropriate antimicrobial/orthopedic management—it constitutes an exact clinical equivalent. No other listed concept fulfills all the specificity, generality, and contextual requirements simultaneously. Therefore, the match is declared as above.",0.8421052631578947

The target concept “Benign lipomatous tumor” is defined as a *benign neoplasm of adipose tissue consisting of mature lipocytes without atypical features*, directly preserving these exact characteristics. It does not add any extra clinical detail (e.g., location, size, or growth pattern) that is not present in the source, thus maintaining the same level of specificity.   - Generality: The target is not more specific than the source; it does not introduce sub‑categories, anatomical site restrictions, or additional histologic features (such as lipoblast predominance or atypia) that would over‑specify the condition.   - Context Validation: The concept belongs to the SNOMED vocabulary, class “Disorder”, and its hierarchy includes “Benign neoplastic disease;Lipomatous tumor”. This classification aligns with the source’s clinical context as a benign neoplasm of adipose tissue. The definition and synonyms (“Benign lipomatous tumor (disorder);Benign lipomatous tumour”) are clinically equivalent to the source term.   - Rule Compliance: The match satisfies the requirement that the target be an exact clinical equivalent—preserving all key attributes (benign nature, adipose composition, mature lipocytes, lack of atypia) while not broadening or narrowing the original term. Therefore, it is the appropriate exact match.",0.8421052631578947

37091346,Disorders of prostate in diseases classified elsewhere,llm,196734,Disorder of prostate,exactMatch,,,,Disorders of prostate in diseases classified elsewhere,200446,Prostatitis associated with another disorder,False,"The source term denotes prostate pathology that is classified under broader disease categories outside the primary prostate chapter, i.e., secondary or associated manifestations of prostate disease.   - Specificity: The target concept “Prostatitis associated with another disorder” precisely describes inflammation of the prostate that occurs secondary to an infection, autoimmune process, or other underlying condition, matching the notion of prostate involvement within a larger classification group. It does not broaden the scope (it is not a generic “Disorder of prostate”) nor does it narrow it with extra details absent from the source.   - Generality: The concept does not over‑specify the source; it does not add clinical details such as a particular etiology or severity that are not implied by the source phrase. It simply captures the same relationship—prostate disorder as a secondary manifestation.   - Context: Within the SNOMED vocabulary, this concept is classified under “Disorder” with parent “Male genital organ disorder associated with another disorder; Prostatitis,” placing it correctly in the hierarchy of prostate‑related conditions that are secondary to other disorders. This aligns with the source’s context of prostate disorders embedded in wider disease categories.    Therefore, the concept 200446 – Prostatitis associated with another disorder is an exact clinical equivalent to the source term.",0.8421052631578947

The target concept “Hormone receptor positive tumor” is defined as a malignant neoplasm with positive staining for estrogen and/or progesterone receptors, indicating potential responsiveness to hormone‑targeted treatments. This definition preserves all key clinical details present in the source: (1) it refers to a malignant neoplasm, (2) it specifies expression of estrogen and/or progesterone receptors, and (3) it conveys that the status can guide hormone‑based therapy. The target does not broaden the meaning (it does not include additional entities beyond hormone‑receptor‑positive neoplasms) and does not over‑specify (it does not limit the disease to a particular organ or add extra descriptive qualifiers). Its vocabulary context (SNOMED, class “Disorder”, domain “Condition”, parent “Neoplastic disease”) is clinically appropriate for the source classification. Therefore, it is an exact clinical equivalent of the source term.",0.8421052631578947
1102631,Hypoglycemia level,llm,24609,Hypoglycemia,exactMatch,,,,Hypoglycemia level,24609,Hypoglycemia,True,"- Specificity: The source term describes a clinical condition characterized by plasma glucose < 70 mg/dL that produces neuroglycopenic symptoms and necessitates therapeutic intervention. The target concept “Hypoglycemia” (SNOMED ID 24609) has the identical definition: “A metabolic state defined by plasma glucose concentrations that fall below the normal reference range (typically < 70 mg/dL), resulting in neuroglycopenic symptoms and requiring therapeutic intervention.” Thus it preserves all key clinical details—severity threshold, symptom complex, and need for treatment—without broadening or omitting any element.  - Generality: The target is not more specific than the source. It does not add extra qualifiers such as a particular etiology, timing, or anatomical site that are absent from the source. It is the generic term for the condition itself, whereas other candidates (e.g., “Hypoglycemic syndrome,” “Hypoglycemic shock,” “Reactive hypoglycemia”) introduce additional pathophysiological or severity details not present in the source definition.  - Context Validation: The target resides in the SNOMED vocabulary, classified under “Disorder” with parents “Hypoglycemic disorder; Disorder of endocrine system.” Its children include various hypoglycemia subtypes, but this hierarchical structure does not over‑specify the source term; it merely reflects the broader category that encompasses the source’s description. The concept’s synonyms (“Hypoglycemia (disorder);Hypoglycaemia”) are consistent with the source’s meaning.  - Rule Compliance: All other target concepts either represent a laboratory finding (“Blood glucose below reference range”), a procedural assay (“Glucose measurement, blood”), a more narrow subtype (“Hypoglycemic shock,” “Reactive hypoglycemia”), or a broader observational category (“Glucose level - finding”). None of these meet the exact clinical equivalence required by the rules. Therefore, the only concept that satisfies the criteria of an exact clinical equivalent is SNOMED 24609, “Hypoglycemia.”   Hence, the precise match is 24609 (Hypoglycemia).",0.8421052631578947

1411507,Pick's disease dementia (machine translation),llm,44782710,Dementia due to Pick's disease,exactMatch,,,,Pick's disease dementia (machine translation),44782710,Dementia due to Pick's disease,True,"- Specificity: The source term describes a *progressive neurodegenerative dementia* that is *caused by Pick disease pathology*, with *frontal and anterior temporal lobe atrophy*, *early behavioral disinhibition*, *executive dysfunction*, *language impairment*, a *poorer prognosis than Alzheimer's disease*, and *no disease‑modifying therapy*—management is purely supportive. The target concept “Dementia due to Pick's disease” explicitly states that it is a *neurodegenerative dementia resulting from Pick disease* with *progressive frontal and temporal lobe atrophy*, *behavioral disinhibition*, and *language deficits*; it also notes that the *prognosis is generally poorer than Alzheimer's disease* and that *treatment is supportive, aimed at symptom management*. All of these clinical details (location, behavioral and language manifestations, prognosis comparison, and therapeutic approach) are preserved verbatim, satisfying the requirement that the target not be more general than the source.  - Generality: The target does not add any extra clinical details that are absent from the source term. It does not specify subtypes, genetic mutations, or pathological findings (e.g., Pick bodies) that are not mentioned in the source. Therefore, it does not over‑specify the condition.  - Context Validation: The target is classified within the SNOMED vocabulary as a *Disorder* under the hierarchy *Frontotemporal dementia; Cerebral degeneration associated with another disorder; Dementia due to disorder of central nervous system*. Its synonyms include “Dementia co‑occurrent and due to Pick's disease (disorder)”, “Dementia due to Picks disease”, and “Dementia due to Pick disease”, all of which map directly to the source term’s meaning. The concept’s children (“Altered behavior due to Pick's disease”) further reflect the behavioral aspects highlighted in the source.  - Rule Compliance: The match respects both specificity and generality constraints, aligns with the appropriate clinical context, and does not rely on non‑essential qualifiers such as “unspecified” or “not otherwise specified”. Consequently, it represents an exact clinical equivalent to the source term.   Thus, the source term Pick's disease dementia (machine translation) is precisely captured by the target concept 44782710 – Dementia due to Pick's disease.",0.8421052631578947
45563320,Polydipsia,llm,432454,Excessive thirst,exactMatch,,,,Polydipsia,432454,Excessive thirst,True,"- Specificity: The source term “Polydipsia” is defined as an abnormal increase in thirst or fluid intake, manifested as excessive drinking. The target concept “Excessive thirst” precisely captures the heightened desire to drink fluids, which is the core clinical manifestation of polydipsia. It does not add any extra clinical detail (e.g., etiology, associated disorders) that would broaden the meaning, thus preserving all key aspects of the source term.    - Generality: “Excessive thirst” is not a more specific subtype of polydipsia (e.g., it does not specify “primary” or “psychogenic” polydipsia). It remains at the same level of abstraction as the source term, describing the same observable symptom without additional qualifiers.    - Context Validation:     - Vocabulary: Both the source and target are recorded under the SNOMED vocabulary.     - Concept Class: The target is classified as a “Clinical Finding,” matching the source’s status as a clinical sign/symptom.     - Parents/Children: The target’s parent is “Thirst finding,” directly aligning with the source’s description of an abnormal thirst. Its children include “Primary polydipsia;Panhypophysitis,” indicating that “Excessive thirst” serves as a broader finding under which specific polydipsia-related disorders can be sub‑categorized—consistent with the source’s role as the underlying sign.     - Synonyms: The target lists “Excessive thirst (finding)” among its synonyms, directly mirroring the source definition.    - Rule Compliance: The target is neither broader (e.g., “Increased thirst” without the “excessive” qualifier) nor narrower (e.g., “Primary polydipsia” or “Compulsive water drinking”). It therefore satisfies the requirement that the match must be an exact clinical equivalent; any other candidate would either over‑specify (adding etiology or behavior) or under‑specify (lacking the “excessive” qualifier).    Consequently, “Excessive thirst” (SNOMED ID 432454) is the exact clinical counterpart to the source term “Polydipsia.”",0.8421052631578947
1423175,Pregnant women with pelvic inflammatory disease (machine translation),llm,4060296,Infections of the genital tract in pregnancy,broadMatch,,,,Pregnant women with pelvic inflammatory disease (machine translation),-1,no_match,True,"- The source term specifies a *single* clinical entity: pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) occurring in pregnant women. This requires preservation of three key details: (1) the diagnosis of PID, (2) the involvement of the female genital tract (upper reproductive structures), and (3) the pregnant state of the patient.   - None of the provided target concepts satisfy all three constraints simultaneously:     - Infections of the genital tract in pregnancy (id 4060296) is broader; it includes any genital infection in pregnancy (e.g., bacterial vaginosis) and does not single out PID. Hence it is *more general* than the source, violating Rule 1 (Specificity).     - Acute parametritis (id 4060950) and Chronic parametritis and pelvic cellulitis (id 193814) are more *specific* (they denote a particular acute or chronic form of parametrial inflammation) and do not explicitly reference pregnancy, violating Rule 2 (Generality).     - Female pelvic inflammatory disease (id 199067) correctly identifies PID but does not incorporate the pregnancy context; it is therefore *more general* with respect to the patient population, again breaching Rule 1.     - Concepts such as Venereal disease in mother complicating pregnancy (id 440158), Maternal gonorrhea during pregnancy (id 442781), and Infectious disease in mother complicating pregnancy (id 433823) are either too broad (encompassing many infections) or too narrow (focused on a single etiologic agent) and none explicitly capture “PID in pregnant women” as a distinct entity.   - Consequently, there is no target concept that exactly matches the source term while preserving all required clinical details. According to Rule 5, when an exact clinical equivalent cannot be found, the appropriate output is `no_match`.",0.8421052631578947
1102832,Progesterone receptor negative status,llm,4261934,Progesterone receptor negative neoplasm,exactMatch,,,,Progesterone receptor negative status,4261934,Progesterone receptor negative neoplasm,True,"The source term denotes a pathology result indicating that tumor cells do not express progesterone receptors, which is used to classify hormone‑receptor‑negative cancers and to guide hormone‑targeted therapy decisions.   - Specificity: The target concept “Progesterone receptor negative neoplasm” precisely describes a malignant tumor lacking progesterone‑receptor expression, preserving the key detail of receptor negativity without adding or omitting any clinical information (e.g., it does not introduce stage, location, or additional biomarkers beyond what the source mentions).   - Generality: It does not over‑specify the source; it does not add extra qualifiers such as stage, histology, or combined receptor negativity that are absent from the source term. The only added term “neoplasm” reflects the inherent context of a tumor, which is consistent with the source’s reference to “tumor cells.”   - Context Validation: The concept is encoded in SNOMED under the “Disorder” class, with the parent “Hormone receptor negative neoplasm,” and its synonyms include “Progesterone receptor negative tumour,” directly aligning with the source’s meaning and clinical use.   - No Better Fit: All other candidates either represent the opposite (positive) status, a laboratory assay, a more specific subtype (e.g., stage‑specific), or a composite measurement, none of which match the exact clinical meaning of a simple “negative status.” Therefore, 4261934 is the exact clinical equivalent.",0.8421052631578947
37083340,Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord in diseases classified elsewhere,llm,140099,Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord,exactMatch,,,,Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord in diseases classified elsewhere,140099,Subacute combined degeneration of spinal cord,True,"The source term names the clinical condition *subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord* and indicates that it occurs “in diseases classified elsewhere,” i.e., as a secondary manifestation of some underlying disorder. This phrasing is a coding qualifier that does not add any additional clinical detail about the lesion itself; it merely situates the condition within a broader diagnostic context.    The target concept (ID 140099) is precisely the same disorder: a demyelinating disease of the posterior and lateral columns of the spinal cord that presents with sensory loss, motor weakness, and gait disturbances. Its definition, parent relationships, and synonyms all refer to *subacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord* as the core condition, without introducing extra clinical descriptors that are absent from the source.    - Rule 1 (Specificity) – The target retains every key clinical detail of the source (anatomical location = spinal cord; pathology = demyelination of posterior/lateral columns; symptoms = sensory and motor deficits). It does not broaden the condition.   - Rule 2 (Generality) – The target does not add any extra detail (e.g., a specific etiologic agent such as vitamin B12 deficiency or nitrous‑oxide exposure) that is not present in the source phrase. The source’s “in diseases classified elsewhere” is a coding note, not a clinical specification, so the target’s generic label is appropriate.   - Rule 3 (Context) – The target’s vocabulary context (SNOMED, class “Disorder”, domain “Condition”) and its parent relationship “Myelopathy due to vitamin B12 deficiency” correctly place the condition within the nervous‑system disorder hierarchy, making it clinically and semantically compatible.   - Rule 4 (Ignore non‑essential phrases) – The qualifier “in diseases classified elsewhere” is ignored, as instructed, because it does not affect the underlying condition’s definition.   - Rule 5 (Exact match) – The target concept is an exact clinical equivalent; therefore a match is declared.    Thus, concept 140099 precisely corresponds to the source term and satisfies all required criteria.",0.8421052631578947
